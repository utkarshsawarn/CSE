Problem Statement
This project consists of a set of Python programs designed to solve various problems related to number theory. It includes functions to check properties of numbers (like prime, palindrome, abundant, etc.), perform mathematical calculations (like factorial, digital root), and run modular arithmetic algorithms. The main challenge is to provide easy-to-understand and efficient implementations of these fundamental number-theoretic computations while also reporting performance metrics like execution time and memory usage.

Scope of the Project
The scope covers a wide range of common and advanced number theory tasks that can be used for studying, testing algorithms, or building blocks for more complex mathematical software. It does not focus on a single application but provides multiple small utilities bundled together, making it a versatile educational and utility tool for number theory enthusiasts.
